// 1. Six Basics Fundamentals

/* 
    1.1 variable (const, let)
        const => const variable are declare then, when we know that the variable value couldn't be change.
        Ex. 
            const name = 'Rajebul Alam Khokan';
            console.log(name);

        let => let variable are declare then, when we know that the varible value could be change or assign a new value.
        Ex.
            let salary = 50000;
            salary = 100000;
            console.log(salary);

        => Three Types of Variable
        1. string = string means assigning text.
            Ex.
                const string = 'Rajebul Alam Khokan';
                console.log(typeof string); 

        2. number or numeric = number means means assigning number.
            Ex.
                const number = 12345;
                console.log(typeof number);

        3. boolean = boolean means a condition that could be true or false.
            Ex.
                const isActive = true;
                console.log(typeof isActive);
